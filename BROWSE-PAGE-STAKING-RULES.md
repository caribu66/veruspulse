# 📋 Browse Page - Staking Rules Implementation

## ✅ **Confirmed: Browse Page Uses Correct Staking Rules**

**Last Verified:** October 28, 2025

---

## 🎯 **Staking Rules Applied**

The `/verusid/browse` page correctly implements the **trending staking rules**:

### Rule #1: Direct I-Address Stakes Only ✅

**Requirement:** Only count stakes where the **source address equals the identity address**.

**Implementation:**

```sql
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM staking_rewards sr
  WHERE sr.identity_address = i.identity_address
  AND sr.source_address = sr.identity_address  -- CRITICAL: Direct I-address only
  AND sr.block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'  -- Recently active
)
```

**What This Does:**

- ✅ Only shows VerusIDs that have **directly staked** with their I-address
- ❌ Excludes VerusIDs that only **receive delegated stakes** (like Verus Coin Foundation, Verus Community Pool)
- ✅ Verifies stake authenticity via `staking_rewards` table at query time
- ✅ Must have staked in the **last 30 days** (active requirement)

**Files Ensuring This:**

- `app/api/verusids/browse/route.ts` (lines 56-77, 104)
- `staking_rewards` table (verified at query time with EXISTS subquery)

### Rule #2: Highest Stakers First ✅

**Requirement:** Show the **most active stakers** at the top.

**Implementation:**

```sql
ORDER BY COALESCE(s.total_stakes, 0) DESC, i.base_name ASC
```

**Sorting Priority:**

1. Most stakes (descending)
2. Name (ascending) - for ties

### Rule #3: Real Blockchain Data ✅

**Requirement:** All data must come from **actual blockchain** staking rewards.

**Implementation:**

- Data pulled from PostgreSQL database
- Database has 36,615 VerusIDs
- Statistics calculated from actual `staking_rewards` table
- Only counts verified PoS blocks

### Main Query (Simplified):

```sql
SELECT
  i.identity_address,
  i.base_name,
  i.friendly_name,
  s.total_stakes,              -- From verusid_statistics
  s.total_rewards_satoshis,    -- From verusid_statistics
  s.last_stake_time,           -- Last direct I-address stake
  s.apy_all_time,              -- Calculated APY
  s.network_rank               -- Rank among all stakers
FROM identities i
LEFT JOIN verusid_statistics s ON i.identity_address = s.address
ORDER BY COALESCE(s.total_stakes, 0) DESC
LIMIT 50
```

| **Total Stakes**  | `verusid_statistics.total_stakes`           | ✅ Yes (I-address only)                |
| **Total Rewards** | `verusid_statistics.total_rewards_satoshis` | ✅ Yes (I-address only)                |
| **APY**           | `verusid_statistics.apy_all_time`           | ✅ Yes (calculated from filtered data) |
| **Network Rank**  | `verusid_statistics.network_rank`           | ✅ Yes (ranked among direct stakers)   |
| **Last Stake**    | `verusid_statistics.last_stake_time`        | ✅ Yes (last I-address stake)          |

## 🏆 **Top Stakers (Direct I-Address Only)**

**UPDATED: October 28, 2025**

### ⚠️ **Important Change**

**Removed from leaderboard:**

- ❌ **Verus Coin Foundation** - Receives delegated stakes (not direct I-address)
- ❌ **Verus Community Pool** - Receives delegated stakes (not direct I-address)

**Why they were removed:**

These VerusIDs receive stakes FROM other addresses (delegated rewards), not by staking with their own I-address. The Browse page now correctly filters these out.

### ✅ **True Top Stakers (Direct I-Address Only)**

These VerusIDs stake **with their own I-address** and are **recently active** (last 30 days):

| Rank | VerusID | Stakes | Rewards      | Method           |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 1    | staker  | 16,102 | 120,620 VRSC | Direct I-address |
| 2    | unknown | 15,756 | 189,592 VRSC | Direct I-address |
| 3    | RockPi  | 10,681 | 87,553 VRSC  | Direct I-address |

**All verified with:**

- ✅ `source_address = identity_address` (direct staking)
- ✅ `block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'` (recently active)

## 🔍 **How to Verify**

### Test API Directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/verusids/browse?limit=10
```

### Check Database:

```sql
-- Top 10 stakers by direct I-address stakes
SELECT
  base_name,
  total_stakes,
  total_rewards_satoshis / 100000000.0 as rewards_vrsc
FROM verusid_statistics
ORDER BY total_stakes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Filtering:

```sql
-- Confirm all stakes are direct I-address
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM staking_rewards
WHERE source_address = identity_address;  -- Should match total stakes
```
