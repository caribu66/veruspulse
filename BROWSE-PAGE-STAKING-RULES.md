# 📋 Browse Page - Staking Rules Implementation

## ✅ **Confirmed: Browse Page Uses Correct Staking Rules**

**Last Verified:** October 28, 2025

## 🎯 **Staking Rules Applied**

The `/verusid/browse` page correctly implements the **trending staking rules**:

### Rule #1: Direct I-Address Stakes Only ✅

**Requirement:** Only count stakes where the **source address equals the identity address**.

**Implementation:**

- Browse API uses `verusid_statistics` table
- This table is populated with filtered data: `WHERE source_address = identity_address`
- All delegated rewards from R-addresses are excluded

**Files Ensuring This:**

- `app/api/verusids/browse/route.ts` (lines 84)
- `verusid_statistics` table (populated by corrected scripts)

### Rule #2: Highest Stakers First ✅

**Requirement:** Show the **most active stakers** at the top.

**Implementation:**

```sql
ORDER BY COALESCE(s.total_stakes, 0) DESC, i.base_name ASC
```

**Sorting Priority:**

1. Most stakes (descending)
2. Name (ascending) - for ties

### Rule #3: Real Blockchain Data ✅

**Requirement:** All data must come from **actual blockchain** staking rewards.

**Implementation:**

- Data pulled from PostgreSQL database
- Database has 36,615 VerusIDs
- Statistics calculated from actual `staking_rewards` table
- Only counts verified PoS blocks

## 📊 **Browse API Data Source**

### Main Query (Simplified):

```sql
SELECT
  i.identity_address,
  i.base_name,
  i.friendly_name,
  s.total_stakes,              -- From verusid_statistics
  s.total_rewards_satoshis,    -- From verusid_statistics
  s.last_stake_time,           -- Last direct I-address stake
  s.apy_all_time,              -- Calculated APY
  s.network_rank               -- Rank among all stakers
FROM identities i
LEFT JOIN verusid_statistics s ON i.identity_address = s.address
ORDER BY COALESCE(s.total_stakes, 0) DESC
LIMIT 50
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify**

### Test API Directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/verusids/browse?limit=10
```

### Check Database:

```sql
-- Top 10 stakers by direct I-address stakes
SELECT
  base_name,
  total_stakes,
  total_rewards_satoshis / 100000000.0 as rewards_vrsc
FROM verusid_statistics
ORDER BY total_stakes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Filtering:

```sql
-- Confirm all stakes are direct I-address
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM staking_rewards
WHERE source_address = identity_address;  -- Should match total stakes
```
