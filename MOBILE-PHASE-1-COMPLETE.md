## 🔄 Integration Points

### How to Use Skeletons

function MyComponent() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  if (loading) {
    return <VerusIDSkeleton />;
  }
  
  return <ActualContent />;
}
```

### How to Use Haptics

```tsx
import { haptics } from '@/lib/utils/haptics';

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => {
      haptics.light(); // Add feedback
      doSomething();
    }}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

### How to Use Safe Areas

```tsx
// Add to any element that needs safe spacing
<div className="safe-area-inset-top">
  {/* Content respects notch */}
</div>

// For touch targets
<button className="safe-touch-target">
  {/* Minimum 44x44px */}
</button>
