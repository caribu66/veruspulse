# Quick Start: Creation-Aware Scanning

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 3 Minutes

### Step 1: Test with Single VerusID (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /home/explorer/verus-dapp
node scripts/test-creation-scan.js "joanna@"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
âœ… Creation Block: 1,060,674
âœ… Database updated!
ðŸŽ‰ Efficiency gain: 9.80%
âœ… All stakes verified AFTER creation block
```

---

### Step 2: Run Full Scan (All VerusIDs)

```bash
node scripts/scan-verusids-from-creation.js
```

**What This Does:**

- Fetches creation blocks for all 32,990 VerusIDs
- Updates database with creation info
- Scans from creation to current tip
- Captures stakes AND UTXOs
- Processes 3 VerusIDs in parallel

**Time Estimate:**

- ~2-4 hours for full initial scan
- Much faster on subsequent runs (uses cached creation blocks)

---

### Step 3: Verify Results

```bash
# Check creation blocks were cached
psql postgresql://verus_user:verus_secure_2024@localhost:5432/verus_utxo_db \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as cached FROM identities WHERE first_seen_block IS NOT NULL;"

# Check stakes were captured
psql postgresql://verus_user:verus_secure_2024@localhost:5432/verus_utxo_db \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_stakes FROM staking_rewards;"

# Check UTXOs were updated
psql postgresql://verus_user:verus_secure_2024@localhost:5432/verus_utxo_db \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_utxos FROM utxos WHERE is_spent = false;"
```

## ðŸ“Š Real-World Example

### joanna@ Results

```
Creation: Block 1,060,674 (June 24, 2020)
First Stake: Block 1,077,805 (July 1, 2020)
Total Stakes: 308
Efficiency Gain: 9.80% (260,474 blocks skipped)
```

### Verus Coin Foundation@ Results

```
Creation: Block 800,232 (Dec 15, 2019)
First Stake: Block 1,996,041 (Apr 21, 2022)
Total Stakes: 244
Total Rewards: 2,544.74 VRSC
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The scanner uses these defaults (in `scripts/scan-verusids-from-creation.js`):

```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 100; // Blocks per batch
const PARALLEL_SCANS = 3; // VerusIDs processed in parallel
const CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL = 1000; // Save progress every N blocks
```

**To adjust performance:**

- Increase `PARALLEL_SCANS` for faster scanning (more RPC load)
- Decrease `PARALLEL_SCANS` for lighter RPC load
- Adjust `BATCH_SIZE` based on network speed

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

### For First-Time Scan

- Run during off-peak hours (less RPC load)
- Monitor RPC daemon load with `scripts/monitor-rpc-usage.js`
- Let it complete fully for best caching

### For Ongoing Scans

- Run daily to catch new stakes
- Cached creation blocks make subsequent scans much faster
- Only new VerusIDs need creation block fetching

### Troubleshooting

**If scan is slow:**

```bash
# Check RPC daemon is running
verus getblockchaininfo

# Monitor RPC usage
node scripts/monitor-rpc-usage.js
```

**If errors occur:**

```bash
# Check database connection
psql postgresql://verus_user:verus_secure_2024@localhost:5432/verus_utxo_db -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check RPC credentials in .env
cat .env | grep VERUS_RPC
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Monitoring

The scanner shows real-time progress:

```
ðŸ“‹ Scanning: Joanna.VRSC@
   Address: iPZkWmFAhQSFsgKiLExowaoXvzaor2bBZ5
   âœ… Creation block: 1,060,674
   ðŸ“Š Scan range: 1,060,674 â†’ 3,454,310 (2,393,636 blocks)
   Progress: 50.0% | Stakes: 154
   ðŸ”„ Updating UTXOs...
   âœ… Complete: 308 stakes, 188 UTXOs
```

---

## âœ… Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. âœ… Creation blocks being fetched and cached
2. âœ… Efficiency gains displayed (blocks skipped)
3. âœ… Stakes being found and saved
4. âœ… UTXOs being updated
5. âœ… Progress percentage increasing

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next?

After the initial scan completes:

1. **View Results in UI**
   - Check `/api/verusid-lookup` for creation dates
   - View staking stats with accurate "Created On" dates

2. **Set Up Recurring Scans**
   - Add to crontab for daily updates
   - Example: `0 2 * * * cd /home/explorer/verus-dapp && node scripts/scan-verusids-from-creation.js`

3. **Monitor Efficiency**
   - Track scan times
   - Compare to old scanning method
   - Celebrate the 26-90% improvement! ðŸŽ‰

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RPC connection failed      | Check `.env` has correct `VERUS_RPC_HOST`, `VERUS_RPC_USER`, `VERUS_RPC_PASSWORD` |
| Database connection failed | Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`                                                   |
| Slow performance           | Reduce `PARALLEL_SCANS` in scanner script                                         |
| No creation block found    | VerusID might not exist or RPC daemon is out of sync                              |

**Still stuck?** Run the test script first:

```bash
node scripts/test-creation-scan.js "joanna@"
```

This will validate all components are working correctly!
