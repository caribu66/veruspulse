# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REWARD DISPLAY FIX - NEVER FORGET THIS!

## The Problem:
RPC calls to getrawtransaction were failing (HTTP 500), causing all block rewards to show as 0.

## The Solution:
Use transaction data already available in block.tx[0] instead of making additional RPC calls.

## The Fix:
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN):
const firstTx = await verusAPI.getRawTransaction(block.tx[0], true);

// NEW (WORKING):
const firstTx = block.tx[0]; // Use data already in the block!
```

## Result:
âœ… Before: reward: 0 (broken)
âœ… After: reward: 48 (working!)

## Files:
- docs/REWARD-DISPLAY-IMPLEMENTATION.md (complete guide)
- REWARD-DISPLAY-CRITICAL-FIX.md (essential fix)
- DEVELOPER-NOTES.md (quick reference)

## NEVER DELETE THESE FILES!
They contain the solution that saved the reward display system.
