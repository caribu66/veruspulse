# Simple Staking Status Options

## Current Problem

"Staking Momentum" is too technical and confusing for users.

## Simple Alternative Options

### Option 1: "Activity Status" (RECOMMENDED)

**Simple, clear labels:**

- 🟢 **Active** - You've staked recently (within 7 days)
- 🟡 **Coming Soon** - Expected to stake soon (within expected timeframe)
- 🔴 **Inactive** - Haven't staked in a while

**Plus a simple message:**

- "Last stake: 3 days ago"
- "Expected next stake: ~2 days"
- "No recent stakes"

### Option 2: "Staking Streak"

**Gamification approach:**

- 🔥 **Current Streak: 5 days**
- 🏆 **Best Streak: 15 days**
- 📊 **This Month: 12 stakes**

### Option 3: "Health Score" (0-100)

**Single number with visual gauge:**

- Score based on: recent stakes, rewards received, UTXO health
- 80-100: Excellent (Green)
- 60-79: Good (Yellow)
- Below 60: Needs attention (Red)

### Option 4: "Simple Status"

**Just the facts:**

- ✅ **Staking** - Last stake 2 days ago
- ⏳ **Waiting** - Expected in 3-5 days
- ❌ **Stopped** - Last stake 15 days ago

### Option 5: "Performance Rating"

**Like a grade:**

- **A+** Excellent - Staking frequently
- **B** Good - Regular stakes
- **C** Fair - Occasional stakes
- **D** Poor - Rarely staking

## Recommendation

**Combine Option 1 + Option 3:**

- Show Activity Status (Active/Coming Soon/Inactive)
- Add Health Score (0-100) with color-coded gauge
- Keep it simple with "Last stake: X days ago"

This gives users:

1. Clear status at a glance
2. A simple number to understand
3. Basic timing information

Much simpler than "momentum scores", "trends", and "frequency changes"!
