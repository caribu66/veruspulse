# DEFINITIVE STAKING SCANNER

## The ONE and ONLY Staking Scanning Method

This is the **definitive** staking data scanning solution that has been verified and validated against real blockchain data.

## ✅ Verified Methodology

- **Blockchain Verification**: All stake amounts verified against actual blockchain data
- **VRSC Halving Events**: Properly accounts for reward rate changes over time
- **Correct Calculations**: Uses first output only (not sum of all outputs)
- **Real Data Validation**: Tested against CSV export data from caribu66@

## 🚀 Usage

### Start Scanner

```bash
./start-staking-scanner.sh
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
./monitor-staking-progress.sh
```

### Stop Scanner

```bash
./stop-staking-scanner.sh
```

### Check Database Status

```bash
node check-database-status.js
```

## 📊 What It Does

1. **Scans blockchain blocks** from the last scanned height to current tip
2. **Extracts staking rewards** using verified logic
3. **Accounts for VRSC halving events** (12 → 6 → 3 VRSC over time)
4. **Inserts data into staking_rewards table** with correct amounts
5. **Handles foreign key constraints** by ensuring identities exist first

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Single Process**: No duplicate processes or conflicts
- **Batch Processing**: Processes blocks in batches for efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Continues on errors, logs issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress and ETA
- **Database Safety**: Uses proper transaction handling

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **This is the ONLY staking scanner to use**
- **All other staking scanning methods are deprecated**
- **Always use the provided scripts for starting/stopping**
- **Monitor progress regularly to ensure it's working**

## 🔍 Validation

This scanner has been validated against:

- Real blockchain data verification
- CSV export data from caribu66@ (8,729 VRSC total)
- Multiple address analyses (Joanna: 1,266 VRSC, Caribu66@: 5,073 VRSC estimated)

## 📈 Performance

- Processes ~50 blocks per batch
- 2-second delay between batches to avoid ENOBUFS errors
- Limited database connections to prevent "too many clients" errors
- Estimated completion time varies based on remaining blocks

**Remember: This is the ONE definitive solution. Don't use any other staking scanning methods!**
