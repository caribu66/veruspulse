# 🚀 Duplicate Prevention - Start Here

## ✅ What's New

Your Verus DApp now **automatically prevents duplicate instances** from running. No more port conflicts or confusing errors!

## 🎯 Quick Commands

### Check What's Running

```bash
npm run services:status
```

### Start Services

```bash
npm run dev              # Development server
npm start                # Production server (after npm run build)
```

### Stop Services

```bash
npm run dev:stop         # Stop dev server
npm run stop             # Stop any server
npm run services:stop    # Stop ALL services
```

## 💡 What Happens Now

### Before (Old Behavior)

```bash
$ npm run dev
# Server starts on port 3000

$ npm run dev  # In another terminal
# Server starts AGAIN on port 3000 (ERROR!)
# Port conflict, unclear errors
```

### After (New Behavior)

```bash
$ npm run dev
# Server starts on port 3000

$ npm run dev  # In another terminal
❌ ERROR: A development server is already running!

   PID: 12345
   Port: 3000
   Mode: development

   To stop the existing server:
   1. Use: npm run dev:stop
   2. Or kill: kill 12345
```

## 🛡️ How It Works

1. **Lock Files** - Each service creates a lock file with its PID
2. **Smart Checking** - Automatically detects and removes stale locks
3. **Clear Errors** - Shows exactly what's running and how to stop it
4. **Graceful Cleanup** - Lock files removed on shutdown

## 🧪 Test It Yourself

```bash
# 1. Run the demo
./scripts/demo-duplicate-prevention.sh

# 2. Try duplicate detection
npm run dev
npm run dev  # Try again - will show error

# 3. Check status
npm run services:status

# 4. Stop cleanly
npm run dev:stop
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Already running" but nothing seems to be running?

```bash
npm run services:status  # Check actual status
npm run services:stop    # Stop everything
```

### Port still in use?

```bash
lsof -i :3000           # See what's using port 3000
npm run services:stop   # Clean stop
```

### Clean slate?

```bash
npm run services:stop   # Stop all services
rm .*.lock              # Remove any stale locks
```
