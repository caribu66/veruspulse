/**
 * CRITICAL BUG FIX: Stake Attribution Issue
 *
 * PROBLEM: VerusIDs were showing incorrect rewards because the statistics
 * were counting ALL stakes where the identity_address received rewards,
 * including stakes from OTHER addresses (R-addresses) that paid to the I-address.
 *
 * EXAMPLE: A VerusID with only 193 VRSC was showing 88,937 VRSC in rewards
 * because it was receiving rewards from other addresses that staked on its behalf.
 *
 * SOLUTION: Only count stakes where source_address = identity_address
 * (i.e., direct I-address stakes only)
 *
 * This script:
 * 1. Analyzes the current state to show the extent of the problem
 * 2. Recalculates all statistics with the correct filter
 * 3. Shows before/after comparison
