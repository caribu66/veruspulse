 * - Only stakes where source_address = identity_address (I-address) are counted for VerusID statistics
 * - VerusIDs that receive staking help from other addresses show 0 stakes
 * - The getActualStakingAddress() function determines the real staking address
 * - Direct I-address stakes are logged as "✅ Direct I-address stake"
 * - Indirect stakes are logged as "📝 Indirect stake: I-address <- R-address"
 * 
 * This ensures the VerusID page only shows VerusIDs that staked directly with their I-address.
